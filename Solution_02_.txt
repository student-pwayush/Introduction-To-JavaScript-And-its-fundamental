JavaScript includes various categories of operators: Arithmetic operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators, Assignment operators, Conditional operators.

                 =            Assignment operator	              a = 7; // 7
                 +=	          Addition assignment	              a += 5; // a = a + 5
                 -=	          Subtraction Assignment	          a -= 2; // a = a - 2
                 *=	          Multiplication Assignment	          a *= 3; // a = a * 3
                 /=	          Division Assignment	              a /= 2; // a = a / 2
                 %=	          Remainder Assignment	              a %= 2; // a = a % 2
                 **=	      Exponentiation Assignment	          a **= 2; // a = a**2
