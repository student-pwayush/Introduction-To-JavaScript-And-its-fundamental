 (1) Unary operators:-

(A) Unary operators: which require one operand (Un).

(B) Providing two or more can result in a syntax error.

(C)  E.g. ++, - - etc are unary operators.    

(D)  typeof "hello"
        // string



(2) Binary operators:-

(A) Binary operators: which require two operands (Bi).

(B) Such operators result in a syntax error.

(C) E.g. +,-,*,/ are binary operators.

(D) 

(E)       10 + 20
       // 30

       20 - 5
     // 15

     30 / 6
     // 5



(3) Ternary operators:- 

(A) Ternary operators: which require three operands (Ter).

(B) In JavaScript, there is one operator that falls under this category â€“ the conditional operator. 

(C) In other languages, perhaps, there could be more examples.

(D)  The ternary operator is a simplified conditional operator like if / else.

Syntax: condition ? <expression if true> : <expression if false>

Here is an example using if / else:

(E)    const score = 80
      const scoreRating = score > 50 ? "Good" : "Poor"

      // "Good"
