The code is read by at least two entities, the computer and future you. In the case of using non-descriptive variable names, the former won’t complain as long as there are no error on the syntax. 
The latter, on the other hand, will spend longer time figuring out what the code does than the total time it would’ve taken for you to write descriptive variable names.

Read again the word I wrote in italic. Descriptive, not “long”. It should be clear and consistent. It doesn’t have to be long, but don’t worry if it is needed for clarity.
